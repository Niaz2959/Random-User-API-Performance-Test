# Random-User-API-Performance-Test-Using-Jmeter

## About this Project
### In this project I have perfomed the performance test on a demo server by performing load test. Here, from load test on jmeter, I have found out the actual TPS (throughput per second) and expected TPS. Moreover, by performing more load test on the same URL, I have found out the bottleneck/stress test point (at which point the system starts to show 1% error).

## Tools & Technology used:
- Jmeter

## Prerequisites
- JDK 8 or JDK 11  

## How to Run:
- Clone this project
- Setup Jmeter_HOME
- Click on apache-jmeter-5.6.2\bin\ApacheJMeter.jar
- Save the jmx file in bin folder and open the jms file in jmeter
